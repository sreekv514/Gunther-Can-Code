Hello Please help Gunther understand how code is working and why the answer will be this . Explain the working of code in detail. Doubt image is attatched which you have to explain.

Explanation in the code below. The available options for the answer in the app are wrong.

Code:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int a=5, b=6, c, d;
/*4 variables declared, a&b are also initialized */

	c = a, b;
/* This is a simple assignment and b is ignored, so c = a = 5 */

	d = (a, b);
/* (a, b) will give d = b since in parentheses, comma acts as a binary operator. a is evaluated and discarded, then b is evaluated and its value is returned.  */

	cout<<c<<' '<<d;
/*O/P: 5 6 */

	return 0;
}
